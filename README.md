# wow another fuckin cube cavern engine just what we needed dude.

currently i'm the only one working on this, and i'm probably not accepting contributers right now. (as if anyone would want to)

would be nice to in the future tho.

Written in C++ with the ISO-C++17 Standard, using SDL2 and OpenGL, GLAD as the OpenGL function loader, with Lua being used for game logic and the modding API.

Made for the MSVC compiler, what version? idfk.

brought to you by the mr washee washees cube cavern guy (yeah i'm, pretty much famous, you must already know me.)

also wanted to name this "the real c++" as a reference to the misleading c++ cube cavern engine on roblox (i originally thought it was some kinda c++ (programming language) interpreter on roblox when i first saw it)

now that i mentioned it, the code structure is inspired by the cube cavern+ engine (i refer to the c++ cc engine by Elyzzia as cube cavern+)


now, now. my C++ might be a little horrid, but i don't have all that much experience with writing CLEAN C++ code, this is the first time i've bothered to try.

i don't even have a year of experience with C++ lmmaaaoooo

made for fun, you can use this as your own "Cube Cavern" engine, if you really hate yourself that much.

fr tho you're probably better off using one of the CC engines on roblox.

welcome to inheritance hell.

## TODO

- read through, the licenses of the libraries i'm using, don't think i'm doing that anytime soon.
- kill myself (POSTPONED)
- lua support (this is the branch for it bud!)
- lil enemy guys
- interactables
- multiplayer? (No)
- literally everything oh my goddddd.

## NOTES

### 1. savoury, why so many branch prediction hints? are you restarted?

well, i want the engine to run better, and yes, i know the performane gain is very, very small, micro-optimization if you will, and adds quote end quote "clutter" to the code (doesn't seem cluttered to me)

yes, i do also know the compiler can predict what branch is most likely and slot in code for those cases, i'll get to that in a bit

performance has always been important to me, i used to have one of those dirt cheap dollar store android tablets.

it had 1gb of ram, took half an hour to boot, ran nothing good, and it struggled on the lock and home screen.

i remember playing games at 15-10 fps, while that annoying "(app name) has stopped responding" message pops up every 15 seconds, when it clearly is responding, and i still enjoyed it

if me spending a couple seconds to add those hints has the possibility to squeeze out just a singular frame, it's worth it to me.

and about the compiler being able to mostly predict those circumstances, well, i dont trust no damn compiler, even if the compiler were written by me.

ALSO, i want to maximize the performance of the Lua C Functions, bc modding reasons, of course.

i know i'm dragging it a lot but, my laptop shit yo cpu running at 0.40ghz kinda bad yo


## [Building]
todo: this

Download Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2022, or, whatever newer version is out right now.

uhh yeah go get SDL2 from 'ere: https://www.libsdl.org

glad from here: 

too lazy to write somethin here

you're on your own (shouldn't be too hard to figure out.)\
