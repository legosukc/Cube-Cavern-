# lua-branch is currently what's being worked on.


# wow another fuckin cube cavern engine just what we needed dude.

brought to you by the mr washee washees cube cavern guy (yeah i'm, pretty much famous, you must already know me.)

wanted to name this "the real c++" as reference to the misleading c++ cube cavern engine on roblox (i originally thought it was some kinda c++ interpreter on roblox when i first saw it)

now that i mentioned it, the code structure is inspired by the cube cavern+ engine (i refer c++ as cube cavern+)


Written in C++ and Lua, using SDL2 and OpenGL, GLAD as the OpenGL function loader.

to put it simply, C++ for the engine, and Lua for the, non, engine stuff.

now, now. my C++ might be a little horrid, but i don't have all that much experience with writing CLEAN C++ code, this is the first time i've bothered to try.

i don't even have a year of experience with C++ lmmaaaoooo

made for fun, you can use this as your own "Cube Cavern" engine, if you really hate yourself that much.

fr tho you're probably better off using one of the CC engines on roblox.

welcome to inheritance hell.

## TODO

- kill myself (POSTPONED)
- lua support (IN THE WORKS) - see lua-branch for progress, once the lua api is in good working condition, it will brought over to the main branch.
- maybe multiplayer support somewhere down the line (if i even get there, it's gonna be hell doing that tho i haven't readied a single bit of the code for it 😭)
- lil enemy guys
- interactables
- dungeon generation
- player movement / collision
- literally everything oh my goddddd.
