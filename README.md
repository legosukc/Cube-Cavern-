# wow another fuckin cube cavern engine just what we needed dude.

brought to you by the mr washee washees cube cavern guy (yeah i'm, pretty much famous, you must already know me.)

wanted to name this repo "Cube Cavern Cum Engine" but for once in my life, take something seriously.

haha im sooo funny like im kinda crazy with this whole humor thing

also wanted to name this "the real c++" as reference to the misleading c++ cube cavern engine on roblox (i originally thought it was some kinda c++ interpreter on roblox when i first saw it)

now that i mentioned it, the code structure is inspired by the cube cavern+ engine (i refer c++ as cube cavern+)


Written in C++, using SDL2 and OpenGL, GLAD as the OpenGL function loader.

now, now. my C++ might be a little horrid, but i don't have all that much experience with writing CLEAN C++ code, this is the first time i've bothered to try.

i don't even have a year of experience with C++ lmmaaaoooo

made for fun, you can use this as your own "Cube Cavern" engine, if you really hate yourself that much.

fr tho you're probably better off using one of the CC engines on roblox.

welcome to inheritance hell.
